// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We created variable 'name' and set it to 'Dane'.
// Next, we made a conditional statement that checked if our name variable is equal to Mary.
// Our name variable does not equal Mary.
// console.log will say 'How do you do?'

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Created two variables: 'secret' but did not set it and 'code' is set as '123'.
// Then checked to see if 'code' is equal and an exact match to 123 which is true. console.log will say 'super' as 'secret' is set as such.
// 'code' will then be multiplied by 2 and equal 246.
// 'code' will not be greater than 250, so 'duper' will not be logged.

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Three variables are set; 'isStudent' set as true, 'age' set as 34, and 'zip' set as 55407.
// We check to see if 'isStudent' and exact match to true and 'zip' is greater than 80000. Since 'zip' is too small, 'You're a studen on the West Coast' will not be logged.
// Then we check to see if 'isStudent' an exact match too false or if 'age' is les than 30. Both of these conditions aren't met so 'What's your hobbies?' Will not be logged
// We check to see if 'isStudent' is an exact match to true. This is the case and the log will say 'Welcome to Prime'.
// The final else statement will not run because the previous condition had beem met.

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*

// FIX
// colorOne is set to red but should be set to blue.
// colorTwo is set to blue but should be set to red.
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

// FIX:
// Instructions state 'and' but the code states 'or'. The '||' should be '&&'.
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

// FIX:
// Instructions state 'greater than or equal to minAge'. We change the code from '<= to >='.
// Since 'age >= minAge' is true, the correct output is 'no entry'.

/*
let age = 21;
